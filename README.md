# ðŸŒ† City Skyline Project

This is my implementation of the **FreeCodeCamp "Build a City Skyline" project**.  
I practiced using **CSS variables**, **gradients**, and **responsive design** while building a stylized skyline with HTML and CSS.  

## ðŸš€ Features
- CSS custom properties (`--variables`) for reusable colors  
- Linear and repeating gradients for building and window effects  
- Scalable units (`vh`, `vw`) for responsiveness  
- Layered background effects
